Prisma Puppet Project - Beginning Date: 10/11/2014
@Author: Alberto Di Savia Puglisi

This project's aim is to deploy a working openstack environment in one shot.
Of course it's a WORK IN PROGRESS and I really hope it will come to an end!

What does work:
  > Basic puppet settings
  > Hiera and librarian-puppet
  > Galera cluster of MariaDB database servers
  > 2 Haproxy load balancers for the Galera cluster
  > HA of these load balancers through Keepalived
  > Openstack Users, DBs and Privileges entries
  
What should work better:
  > 
  
Next steps:
  > Rabbitmq cluster
  > GlusterFS cluster

HOWTO
  1) Modify the /data/common.yaml file according to your needs.
  
  2) Edit the /manifests/nodes.pp to choose:
    > $galera_nodes -> the number of hosts the haproxy lb and the galera module itself should consider (3, 4 or 5). 
      3 is the default value.
    > priority (haproxy-X) -> the priority of each load balancer. 100 and 101 are default values and should be ok.
  Remember that if you choose a different value for the hosts number,
  a coherent editing of the /data/common.yaml is needed!!!
  
  3) After you've completed the previous stages, run the following command in order to apply your manifest:
    sh prisma/modules/puppet/files/papply.sh
  
  4) Next time you wish to apply the manifest simply use the 'papply' command.
